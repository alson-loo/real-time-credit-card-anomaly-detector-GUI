**<u>Real-time credit card fraud anomaly detector with GUI</u>**

This is my final capstone project which implements a GUI for a role-based system using multi-layer perceptron to detect anomalies written in python. The supervisor decides on the model hyperparameters and the time for automatic retraining. While the analyst changes any misclassifications by the system if any customer calls in to clarify on the transactions being misclassified. The model learns from any misclassification and accuracy improves.
